# Notes - Full Stack Application

This is my first full stack development project. The backend, was built using Node.js, while the user interface, was an adaptation of a prior project I developed during the NLW Expert course.
The greatest challenge of this project was learning to create a database, as well as implementing functionalities for user creation and authentication. As an addition to the project, I also included automated tests.

```When trying to log in or register, please wait around 1 minute or more, the backend is hosted on a free service and has this period of inactivity!```
